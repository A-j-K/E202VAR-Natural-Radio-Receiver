# E202VAR Natural Radio Receiver 
####Based on the Explorer E202

Renato Romero put plans online for a Very Low Frequency (VLF) receiver capable between "a few Hz to beyond 10 kHz [which] makes it suitable to to receive radio signals of natural origin; signals not generated by human activity but by physical phenomena such as lightning and solar storms. Received signals are heard directly in your headset. The receiver amplifies the electric component of an electromagnetic signal."

His plans are <a href="http://www.vlf.it/romero2/explorer-e202.html">described here</a>. The Explorer E202 is no longer available for sale.

He gave me permission to work from his schematic to design a new layout and make my own units. I am releasing all of my documents and process under the CERN Open Hardware License v1.2.

#### Current Project Status

- [x] Get permission and verify that the CERN license is OK.
- [x] Initially verify all the components and build the BOM.
- [x] Create the schematic. 
- [ ] Double check the BOM against schematic and available parts.
- [ ] Create an Eagle library with all symbols + footprints.
- [ ] Release the BOM and library.
- [ ] Figure out what to do about the mechanical assembly + case.
- [ ] Create the board layout to fit the proposed case.
- [ ] Order parts.
- [ ] Order boards.
- [ ] Assemble the boards.
- [ ] Test!
